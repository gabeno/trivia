## Trivia

This is a simple **node CLI** game which I have made in the process of teaching myself programming. I love JavaScript hence the bias for the node environment.

## Contibuting

This is a very basic game and would definitely do with some improvements. Feel free to open an issue.

## Roadmap

- Improve randomization which is currently implemented w/ `Math.random()` function.
- Perhaps a more sophisticated `mask()` algorithm.
- An easier way to set new words.
- Intuitively set the number of chances for a player based on the difficulty of the word
- Add a _play again_ behaviour/option so that game does not end after each round.
