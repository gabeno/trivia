## Trivia

This is a simple node cli game which I have made in the process of teaching myself programming

I love JavaScript hence the bias for the node environment.

## Contibuting

This s a very basic game and would definitely do with some improvements. Feel free to open an issue.

## Roadmap

- Improve randomization currently implemented w/ `Math.random()` function
- Perhaps a more sophisticated `mask()` algorithm
- Ability to set new words from the cli
- Intuitively set the number of chances for a player based on the difficulty of the word
- Add a play again behaviour so that game does not end after each round.s
